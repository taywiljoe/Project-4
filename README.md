- sequential model
- Tableau
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

## Data Components
- Gender
- Age
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Smoking History
- BMI
- HbA1c Levels
- Blood Glucose Levels
- Diabetes (y/n)

## Tasks
Taylor- Visualizations
Dev- Visualizations
Kiki- Tableau Visualizations/Presentation slides
Lyvia- Tableau Visualizations
Alan- Sequential Machine Learning

## Data Source:
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset/data
  
## Questions to answer:
1. Are males or females more likely to develop Diabetes and at what age?
2. Does smoking increase someone's risk of developing Diabetes?
